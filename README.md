### âœ¨ Projects & Highlights

I love working on projects that demonstrate the power of AI. Here are a couple of recent highlights:

* **Log Summarizer (T5-small)**: Developed an NLP-powered tool using a fine-tuned T5-small model to condense lengthy log entries into concise, human-readable summaries, significantly aiding in log analysis and security monitoring.
* **Fake News Detection App**: Created a Streamlit web application that classifies news headlines/articles as real or fake using a pre-trained machine learning model and TF-IDF vectorization, providing real-time predictions and confidence scores.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see more of my work!
